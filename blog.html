      <h3>What is forensic statistics and why it differs from traditional statistics</h3>

        When people think of statistics, they usually imagine surveys, economic indicators, 
        or clinical trials. In all these cases, the goal is to estimate general parameters: 
        the average of a population, the effect of a treatment, or the relationship between variables.  
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Forensic statistics</strong>, however, has a very different purpose: 
        to evaluate the <em>probative value</em> of data collected in a judicial context. 
        Rather than working with representative samples, forensic statisticians must often 
        interpret a single piece of evidence – such as a partial DNA profile – and ask:  
        <blockquote>
          How much does this evidence support the hypothesis that the suspect is involved, 
          compared to the hypothesis that they are not?
        </blockquote>
      </p>
      <p>
        This shift in perspective introduces unique challenges: partial and noisy data, 
        small population references, and above all the legal consequences of statistical 
        reasoning. Forensic statistics relies heavily on likelihood ratios and Bayesian 
        frameworks, ensuring that uncertainty is modelled explicitly and transparently.  
      </p>
      <p>
        As new data types emerge, such as DNA methylation for age and lifestyle inference, 
        the need for robust, interpretable statistical methods becomes even more pressing. 
        Forensic statistics is thus a field where mathematics, biology, law, and ethics meet, 
        and where each case requires tailor-made solutions.
