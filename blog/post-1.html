      <h2>What is forensic statistics and why it differs from traditional statistics</h2>
      <p><em>Posted on March 15, 2018</em></p>

      <p>
        When people think of statistics, they usually imagine surveys, economic indicators, 
        or clinical trials. In all these cases, the goal is to estimate general parameters: 
        the average of a population, the effect of a treatment, or the relationship between variables.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Forensic statistics</strong>, however, has a very different purpose: 
        to evaluate the <em>probative value</em> of data collected in a judicial context. 
        Rather than working with representative samples, forensic statisticians must often 
        interpret a single piece of evidence – such as a partial DNA profile – and ask:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        How much does this evidence support the hypothesis that the suspect is involved, 
        compared to the hypothesis that they are not?
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        This shift in perspective introduces unique challenges: partial and noisy data, 
        small population references, and above all the legal consequences of statistical reasoning. 
        A central concept here is the 
        <a href="post2.html">Likelihood Ratio (LR)</a>, 
        which provides a transparent way to compare the strength of the evidence under competing hypotheses.
      </p>

      <p>
        Forensic statistics is therefore not only about mathematics, but also about law and ethics. 
        It requires methods that are both rigorous and understandable, so that scientific results 
        can be meaningfully discussed in court.
