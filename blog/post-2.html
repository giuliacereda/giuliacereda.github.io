      <h2>What exactly is the Likelihood Ratio?</h2>
      <p><em>Posted on February 20, 2019</em></p>

      <p>
        In the <a href="post1.html">previous post</a> we introduced forensic statistics as the 
        science of evaluating the probative value of evidence. One of the most important tools 
        for doing so is the <strong>Likelihood Ratio (LR)</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        The idea is simple: when faced with a piece of evidence, we compare two competing 
        explanations – typically the hypothesis of the prosecution (e.g. "the DNA comes from the suspect") 
        and the hypothesis of the defence (e.g. "the DNA comes from someone else").
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        The Likelihood Ratio tells us how many times more likely the evidence is under one 
        hypothesis compared to the other.
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        For example, suppose a DNA profile from a crime scene matches a suspect. 
        If such a match would occur in 1 out of a million unrelated individuals, 
        the evidence is a million times more likely under the prosecution’s hypothesis 
        than under the defence’s. In this case, the LR is 1,000,000.
      </p>

      <p>
        Importantly, the LR does not tell us whether the suspect is guilty or not. 
        Rather, it quantifies how much the evidence <em>shifts the balance</em> between 
        the two competing hypotheses. It is then up to the court to combine this information 
        with all other elements of the case.
      </p>

      <p>
        The strength of the LR approach lies in its transparency: it makes explicit the 
        assumptions, allows clear communication of the evidential weight, and can be applied 
        consistently across different types of forensic data.
