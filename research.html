    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>My research topics span <strong>probabilistic and statistical modelling</strong>, <strong>evaluation of genetic data</strong>, and <strong>forensic science</strong>, with a strong focus on developing transparent and rigorous frameworks applicable to real-world contexts.</p>

    <h3>Forensic Likelihood Ratio Modelling</h3>
    <p>I have developed new methodologies for the evaluation of <strong>likelihood ratios (LR)</strong> in forensic DNA evidence, especially when dealing with <em>rare haplotype matches</em> and <em>low-template DNA</em>. My contributions include Bayesian and frequentist solutions to handle <strong>the rare type match problem</strong> </p>
    
    
    <h3>Bayesian Nonparametric Inference</h3>
    In <em>A Nonparametric Bayesian Approach to the Rare Type Match Problem</em>, I propose a fully Bayesian LR calculation based on a Poisson–Dirichlet prior, avoiding the bias of plug-in estimators. The framework was shown to significantly improve evidential assessment when dealing with unseen DNA profiles :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}.
    </blockquote>
    <p>Another work, <em>Comparing Soft Classification Methods for the Rare Type Match Problem</em>, benchmarks various LR estimation strategies as classifiers, evaluating their calibration and refinement using proper scoring rules in forensic scenarios :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}.</p>

    <p>As part of advancing theoretical foundations, in <em>Learning the Two Parameters of the Poisson–Dirichlet Distribution with a Forensic Application</em>, I analyzed MCMC and ABC methods to estimate the hyperparameters of the PD prior, comparing approximation vs fully Bayesian inference. This study highlighted the overestimation of LR when using maximum likelihood versus fully integrated Bayesian models :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}.</p>

    <h3>BGA Inferenc from SNPs data </h3>

    More recently, my research has focused on applying <strong>machine learning techniques</strong> 
  to <strong>single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data</strong> for 
  <strong>biogeographic ancestry (BGA) inference</strong>. 
  This work explores how genomic patterns can be leveraged to infer population origins 
  in a statistically rigorous and ethically responsible manner.
     
    <h3>Epidemiological and Public Health Modelling</h3>
    <p>I have also contributed to multiple studies using compartmental models and Bayesian meta-analysis to inform public health decisions, particularly during the COVID‑19 pandemic. These works focus on forecasting epidemic dynamics, designing optimal screening plans, and providing actionable models for prevention strategies in school settings.</p>
