   <h2>Welcome</h2>
  <p>I am an <strong>Associate Professor of Statistics</strong> at the University of Florence (SSD SECS-S/01 â€“ Statistics). My work mainly lies at the intersection of <strong>statistical modeling</strong> and <strong>forensic science</strong>, with particular interest in the methodological aspects of the  <em>evaluation of DNA match through likelihood ratios</em> and <em>evaluation of rare type match problem</em> .</p>

  <p>My main research interests include the development of <strong>probabilistic frameworks</strong> for forensic inference, especially in challenging scenarios such as <em>rare type matches</em> and <em>low-template DNA</em>. I have worked extensively on the <strong>definition and evaluation of likelihood ratios</strong> from both frequentist and Bayesian perspectives, including the use of <em>object-oriented Bayesian networks</em> to model uncertainty in complex DNA profiles.</p>

  <p>More recently, I have been focusing on <strong>profiling through SNPs data </strong>, and <strong>methylayion data </strong>. My approach blends theoretical rigour with applied insight, contributing tools that are interpretable, ethically grounded, and applicable in real-world forensic and biomedical contexts.</p>
