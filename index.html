   <h2>Welcome</h2>
 <p>
    I am an <strong>Associate Professor of Statistics</strong> at the University of Florence 
    (SSD SECS-S/01 – Statistics). My research lies at the intersection of 
    <strong>statistical modelling</strong> and <strong>forensic science</strong>, with a focus on the 
    methodological aspects of the <em>evaluation of DNA matches through likelihood ratios</em> 
    and the <em>rare type match problem</em>.
  </p>

  <p>
    My main research interests include the development of <strong>probabilistic frameworks</strong> 
    for forensic inference, especially in challenging scenarios such as <em>rare type matches</em> 
    and <em>low-template DNA</em>. I have worked extensively on the 
    <strong>definition and evaluation of likelihood ratios</strong> from both frequentist and Bayesian 
    perspectives, including the use of <em>object-oriented Bayesian networks</em> to model uncertainty 
    in complex DNA profiles.
  </p>

  <p>
    More recently, I have been focusing on <strong>profiling through SNP data</strong> and 
    <strong>methylation data</strong>. My approach blends theoretical rigour with applied insight, 
    contributing tools that are interpretable, ethically grounded, and applicable in real-world 
    forensic and biomedical contexts.
  </p>

<p>
  I have also contributed to multiple studies using compartmental models and Bayesian meta-analysis to inform public health decisions, particularly during the COVID‑19 pandemic
 </p>
    
  <p>
    I teach Statistics and Statistics applied to Forensic Science at both Bachelor’s and Master’s level.
