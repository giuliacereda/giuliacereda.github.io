   <h2>Welcome</h2>
  <p>I am an <strong>Associate Professor of Statistics</strong> at the University of Florence (SSD SECS-S/01 – Statistics). My work lies at the intersection of <strong>statistical modeling</strong>, <strong>genetics</strong>, and <strong>forensic science</strong>, with applications ranging from <em>DNA mixture interpretation</em> to <em>epigenetic profiling</em> and <em>population-level health modeling</em>.</p>

  <p>My main research interests include the development of <strong>probabilistic frameworks</strong> for forensic inference, especially in challenging scenarios such as <em>rare type matches</em> and <em>low-template DNA</em>. I have worked extensively on the <strong>definition and evaluation of likelihood ratios</strong> from both frequentist and Bayesian perspectives, including the use of <em>object-oriented Bayesian networks</em> to model uncertainty in complex DNA profiles.</p>

  <p>More recently, I have been focusing on <strong>epigenomic data analysis</strong>, particularly using <em>DNA methylation</em> to infer behavioural or environmental exposures. My approach blends theoretical rigour with applied insight, contributing tools that are interpretable, ethically grounded, and applicable in real-world forensic and biomedical contexts.</p>
